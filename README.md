UnitTest++
==========

Why extending unittest++
---

UnitTest++ is a great tool, written in a very straitforward way. Maybe for that reason UnitTest++ lacks of some features.
Those features are very important to me, so instead of learning a new units test framework, I will add those features 
to unittest++.


Roadmap of new features (TENTATIVE)
---
 
 * Adding a better test report form, using differents colors and clear explanations of the results.
 * Making possible to run specifics tests instead of running all the test at the same time.
 * Providing a mocking function support (UNIX-like OS).
