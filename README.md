UnitTest++ [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vicentebolea/unittest-cpp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vicentebolea/unittest-cpp)
==========

Why extending unittest++?
-------------------------

UnitTest++ is a great tool, written in a very straighforward way. Maybe for that reason UnitTest++ lacks of some features.
Those features are very important to me, so instead of learning a new units test framework, I will add those features 
to unittest++.


Roadmap of new features (TENTATIVE)
-----------------------------------
 
 - [x] Better test report form, using differents colors and clear explanations of the results.
 - [ ] Possible to run specifics tests instead of running all the test at the same time.
 - [ ] Mocking function support (UNIX-like OS).
